I am Naixu Guo (郭 乃绪), a Ph.D. student at [CQT](https://www.quantumlah.org/) (NUS) advised by [Patrick Rebentrost](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XWHSBmUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Miklos Santha](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=pER3wbkAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my bachelor in 2020 from Kyoto University. Later, I received my master in 2022 from Osaka University, advised by Keisuke Fujii and Kosuke Mitarai.

More information can be seen in this [interview by CQT](https://www.quantumlah.org/about/highlight/2024-11-meet-guo-naixu).

Research interests
======
The polar star of my research direction is the interaction between nature and intelligence.
To provide a meaningful scope, I currently focus on the interplay between quantum systems, representing nature, and statistical learning theory and machine learning, embodying intelligence.
Some of the topics that I am actively considering are
* Quantum linear algebra and its applications
* Understanding quantum many-body systems via the lens of (theoretical) computer science
