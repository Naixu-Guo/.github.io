I am Naixu Guo (郭 乃绪), a Ph.D. student at [CQT](https://www.quantumlah.org/) (NUS) advised by [Patrick Rebentrost](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XWHSBmUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Miklos Santha](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=pER3wbkAAAAJ&hl=en).
Daily, I usually use my secondary personal name Wenyuan (文渊).


Research interests
======
The fundamental research problem for me is the *nature-intelligence interaction*, including
* How far can intelligence learn about nature?
* How well can intelligence play with nature, maybe crazy enough to program the universe?
* Can we quantify what is intelligence and enhance it?

I seek to use physics as the language of nature and computational methodologies to quantify learnability.
Right now, for "intelligence", I focus on our human beings; for nature, I mainly consider quantum systems.
With the amazing practical performances of artificial intelligence, I also wonder how these results can help us to deepen our understanding of intelligence and the possibility of accelerating scientific discovery.
