I am Naixu Guo (郭 乃绪), a Ph.D. student at CQT(NUS) advised by Patrick Rebentrost and Miklos Santha.
In life, I am also a Guqin (古琴) player, advised by Muka Fushimi and graduated in 2022.

Research interests
======
My research aims to understand fundamental computational and learning ability of quantum systems and possible applications of quantum computers.
I am also broadly interested in theoretical computer science and theoretical physics.
