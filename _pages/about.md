I am Naixu Guo (郭 乃绪), a Ph.D. student at [CQT](https://www.quantumlah.org/) (NUS) advised by [Patrick Rebentrost](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XWHSBmUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Miklos Santha](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=pER3wbkAAAAJ&hl=en).
Daily, I usually use my secondary personal name Wenyuan (文渊).


Research interests
======
My current research interests involve quantum information science, with a focus on quantum learning and quantum algorithms.
Some of the topics that I am actively considering are
* Can the ML methods help to probe quantum systems with theoretical guarantees?
* What kind of (properties of) quantum systems that are efficiently learnable?
* How to simplify the current quantum algorithms? e.g., early fault-tolerant
  
With the great progress of artificial intelligence, I also wonder how these can help deepen our understanding of intelligence and the possibility of accelerating scientific discovery.
The polar star of my research direction is the *nature-intelligence interaction*, e.g., how far can intelligence learn and utilize nature, can we quantify what intelligence is and enhance it?
